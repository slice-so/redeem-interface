            <p>
              In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
              system of organizational and technical security measures.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
              organizational security measures designed to protect the security
              of any personal information we process. However, despite our
              safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
              transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
              can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
              guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
              third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
              improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
              Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
              transmission of personal information to and from our Services is
              at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
              secure environment.

            <p>
              We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under

              at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor
              and consent to such minor dependentâ€™s use of the Services. If we
              learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of
              age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take
              reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.
              If you become aware of any data we may have collected from
              children under age 18, please contact us at support@slice.so.

              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

              other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to

              practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

              to determine you are the same person about whom we have the

              to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with
              information you have previously provided us. For instance,
              depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to
              provide certain information so that we can match the information
              you provide with the information we already have on file, or we
              may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or
              email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use
              other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
            </p>

              We will only use personal information provided in your request to

              extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information
              from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
              verify your identity from the information already maintained by
              us, we may request that you provide additional information for the
              purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
              fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
              provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
